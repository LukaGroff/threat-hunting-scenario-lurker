 # üìñ **Scenario**
 
The last incident was supposed to be over. One machine compromised, the attacker cut off before they could spread ‚Äî or so we were told.

But something doesn‚Äôt sit right.

A new device started acting strangely. At first glance, it mirrored the earlier compromise: same tools, same timing, same surgical precision. Only this time, the logs were cleaner. Too clean. And yet, traces remained ‚Äî scattered like breadcrumbs that weren‚Äôt meant to be found, or perhaps were meant to be followed.

Someone wants us to see this.

What if the first breach was a smokescreen? A proof of concept? What if this is the real operation?

Some say it‚Äôs just a red team op. Others whisper it‚Äôs something more ‚Äî a buried framework that‚Äôs been lying dormant, waiting for its second trigger.

You‚Äôve been given full access. But not the full story.

üéØ Your job is simple: Prove what really happened.

üß≠ Follow the signs. Trust the data. Question everything.

Good luck, hunter.



## Starting Point

Before you officially begin the flags, you must first determine where to start hunting. Identify where to start hunting with the following intel given: 
1. Days active 2-3 days
2. Executions from Temp folder
3. 15th of June

Identify the first machine to look at*

Query used:
```
DeviceProcessEvents
| where Timestamp between (datetime(2025-06-12T00:00:00Z) .. datetime(2025-06-19T00:00:00Z))
| where FolderPath contains "Temp"
| summarize FirstSeen=min(Timestamp), LastSeen=max(Timestamp), Count=count() by DeviceName
| project DeviceName, FirstSeen, LastSeen, ActiveDays = datetime_diff("day", LastSeen, FirstSeen), Count
| where ActiveDays >= 1 and ActiveDays <= 3
| order by FirstSeen asc
```

üß† **Thought process:** Since the hint was 15th of June, my actual time is different, so I had to look for a machine on 15th of June UTC time. I extended the First seen timestamp to exclude the machines that were there before the 15th of June, I then checked the names and the first and last seen dates, and it led me to either michaelvm or employee- 1257. The rest were the usual names I am used to seeing in the logs.

## üü© Flag 1 ‚Äì Initial PowerShell Execution Detection

**Objective:**

Pinpoint the earliest suspicious PowerShell activity that marks the intruder's possible entry.

**What to Hunt:**

Initial signs of PowerShell being used in a way that deviates from baseline usage.

**Thought:**

Understanding where it all began helps chart every move that follows. Look for PowerShell actions that started the chain.

**Hint:**

1. File path

 üïµÔ∏è **Identify the first suspicious ps1 execution command**

Query used:
```
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "michaelvm"
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "ps1"
| project Timestamp, ProcessCommandLine, FileName, FolderPath
| order by Timestamp asc
```

üß† **Thought process:** The hint of ps1 execution gave away a lot, as I just looked at the target machine's ps1 executions in the process command line that deviated from the usual noise creation. What I found was not just the answer to this flag, but also a clue for a future step, where the attacker migrated. The first execution was at 2025-06-16T05:38:07.9685093Z.

## üü© Flag 2 ‚Äì Reconnaissance Script Hash

**Objective:**

Identify reconnaissance stage binary.

**What to Hunt:**

Local recon indicators

**Thought:**

Recon always comes early ‚Äî it‚Äôs the intruder mapping their new terrain.

 üïµÔ∏è **Identify the standard hashed value associated with the recon attempt**

Query used:
```
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "michaelvm"
| where ProcessCommandLine contains "whoami"
| project Timestamp, FileName, ProcessCommandLine, SHA256, FolderPath, InitiatingProcessFileName
| order by Timestamp asc
```

üß† **Thought process:** I figured, since the first thing you do once you get remote access is type whoami, so i searched for that command in the command line. I found a command 'whoami' of which SHA256 was the right answer, BUT upon inspecting the SHA256 for actual clues of recon i used the KQL below to find a lot of clues for example commands like whoami, schtasks and deleting evidence of onedrivesetup. The evidence of the attacker being present was overwhelming.

```
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "michaelvm"
| where SHA256 == "badf4752413cb0cbdc03fb95820ca167f0cdc63b597ccdb5ef43111180e088b0"
| project Timestamp, ProcessCommandLine, FileName
| order by Timestamp asc
```

<img width="600" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6231c78-0a03-4bd2-813b-ac7b9e82eb37"/>

**Answer: SHA256 = badf4752413cb0cbdc03fb95820ca167f0cdc63b597ccdb5ef43111180e088b0**

## üü© Flag 3 ‚Äì Sensitive Document Access

**Objective:**

Reveal the document accessed/staged by attacker.

**What to Hunt:**

Access to meetings related directories or confidential crypto data.

**Thought:**

The attacker‚Äôs interest in financials reveals their motive ‚Äî follow the money trail.

**Hint:**

1. Board

 üïµÔ∏è **Provide the targeted file**

Query used:
```
DeviceEvents
| where DeviceName == "michaelvm"
| where FolderPath contains "board"
| where ActionType == "SensitiveFileRead"
```

üß† **Thought process:** I used the hint Board well in this case. I knew the SensitiveFileRead is a good way of finding out which file was accessed, if it was important. Then i tried to query the Board for file name and folder path as well as process command line, of which the last two were a good hit.

## üü© Flag 4 ‚Äì Last Manual Access to File

**Objective:**

Track last read of sensitive document.

**What to Hunt:**

Last file open timestamp.

**Thought:**

Late-stage access usually precedes exfiltration ‚Äî timeline alignment matters.


 üïµÔ∏è **Identify the last instance of the file access**

Query used: Same as flag 3


üß† **Thought process:** From the results seen in flag 3, I got the Timestamp of the last file access.

## üü© Flag 5 ‚Äì LOLBin Usage: bitsadmin

**Objective:**

Identify stealth download via native tools.

**What to Hunt:**

bitsadmin.exe with file transfer URL.

**Thought:**

Abusing trusted binaries helps attackers blend in ‚Äî keep an eye on LOLBins.


 üïµÔ∏è **Provide the command value associated with the initial exploit**

Query used:

```
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "michaelvm"
| where Timestamp between (datetime(2025-06-15T00:00:00Z) .. datetime(2025-06-17T00:00:00Z))
| where FileName contains "bitsadmin.exe"
| order by Timestamp asc
```

üß† **Thought process:** I simply followed the hint and I got a straight answer in the logs.

## üü© Flag 6 ‚Äì Suspicious Payload Deployment

**Objective:**

Identify dropped executable payloads that do not align with baseline software.

**What to Hunt:**

New files placed in Temp or uncommon locations, especially with misleading names.

**Thought:**

Payloads must land before they run. Watch Temp folders for staging signs.

**Hint:**

1. Book of financial accounts

 üïµÔ∏è **Identify the suspicious program**

Query used:

```
DeviceFileEvents
| where DeviceName == "michaelvm"
| where Timestamp between (datetime(2025-06-15T00:00:00Z) .. datetime(2025-06-17T00:00:00Z))
| where FileName endswith ".exe"
| where FolderPath has_any ("\\Temp\\", "\\AppData\\", "\\ProgramData\\", "\\Users\\Public\\")
| project Timestamp, FileName, FolderPath, SHA256, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine
| order by Timestamp asc
```

üß† **Thought process:** I sorted the results by file name, that way it was easy to sift through the results and find the odd one out.

## üü© Flag 7 ‚Äì HTA Abuse via LOLBin

**Objective:**

Detect execution of HTML Application files using trusted Windows tools.

**What to Hunt:**

Execution via `mshta.exe` pointing to local HTA scripts.

**Thought:**

HTA-based execution is a social engineering favorite ‚Äî it leverages trust and native execution.

 üïµÔ∏è **Provide the value of the command associated with the exploit**

Query used:

```
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "michaelvm"
| where Timestamp between (datetime(2025-06-15T00:00:00Z) .. datetime(2025-06-17T00:00:00Z))
| where FileName =~ "mshta.exe"
| where ProcessCommandLine has ".hta"
| project Timestamp, ProcessCommandLine, InitiatingProcessFileName, FolderPath, SHA256
| order by Timestamp asc
```

üß† **Thought process:** The hints were good enough for me to find the results directly, where file name was mshta.exe and command line having .hta extensions

<img width="600" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0c40640-28f7-45bc-9314-2a502cfef238"/>

**Answer: "mshta.exe" C:\Users\MICH34~1\AppData\Local\Temp\client_update.hta**

## üü© Flag 8 ‚Äì ADS Execution Attempt

**Objective:**

Track if attackers stored payloads in Alternate Data Streams (ADS).

**What to Hunt:**

DLLs hidden in common file types like `.docx` with `:hidden.dll` behavior.

**Thought:**

ADS hides in plain sight ‚Äî it‚Äôs a classic LOLBin trick to store malware where few would look.

**Hint:**

1. Capitalist

 üïµÔ∏è **Provide the SHA1 value associated**

Query used:

```
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "michaelvm"
| where Timestamp between (datetime(2025-06-15) .. datetime(2025-06-19))
| where InitiatingProcessCommandLine has ":"
| where InitiatingProcessCommandLine has ".dll"
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine, SHA1
| order by Timestamp desc
```

üß† **Thought process:** I filtered for the command line having ":" and ".dll" in it, according to the hint. The compattelrunner.exe sounds like Capitalist so I figures it's the answer which is was. Upon further inspection into the command, I could see that Write-Host 'Final result: 1' command was run before the compattelrunner.exe scan. It's faking the result of a scan ‚Äî potentially to mimic a real system check or mislead defenders. Then, the second command does the actual .inf scan. This staged behavior is often seen in malware to print fake result (decoy), actually scan system or possibly drop drivers or persistence tools.

‚úÖ Conclusion
The attacker leveraged native tools and LOLBins to evade detection, accessed high-value documents, and stealthily exfiltrated them while maintaining persistence. The clean logs indicate deliberate obfuscation and anti-forensic effort.

üõ°Ô∏è Recommendations
	‚Ä¢	Block LOLBins like bitsadmin, mshta via AppLocker or WDAC
	‚Ä¢	Enable script block logging and AMSI
	‚Ä¢	Monitor for PowerShell downgrade attempts (-Version 2)
	‚Ä¢	Watch for registry changes in autorun paths
	‚Ä¢	Alert on suspicious scheduled task creation
	‚Ä¢	Monitor public cloud uploads (e.g.¬†Dropbox, Pastebin)
